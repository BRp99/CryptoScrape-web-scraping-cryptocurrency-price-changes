# Web Scraping 
Welcome to the web scraping starter project! 

This project involves web scraping cryptocurrency price data from CoinMarketCap, using Python with BeautifulSoup for web scraping and pandas for data manipulation.

The extracted data is then visualized using matplotlib.

## Goal

This project aims to improve my Python skills because:

- allows me to engage real web scraping scenarios to reinforce your understanding of Python fundamentals;

- Gain hands-on experience with essential Python libraries such as `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` commonly used in web scraping;

- Analyze the structure of the Python script to better organize the code;

- Work with data extracted from web pages, using `pandas` for data manipulation and `matplotlib` for basic data visualization;

- Time management.

## Dependencies used

- requests - to make HTTP requests;
- BeautifulSoup – to parse HTML and extract data;
- pandas and matplotlib – to generate graph and table for better visualization.

Feel free to clone this repository to explore and experiment web scraping using Python.
