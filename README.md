# Web Scraping Project
Welcome to the web scraping project! 

This project focuses on extracting cryptocurrency price data from CoinMarketCap using Python.

Initially, the data extraction is performed statically using BeautifulSoup for web scraping and pandas for data manipulation. Subsequently, there are plans to explore dynamic data loading using Selenium.

## Goal

This project aims to improve my Python skills because:

- allows me to engage real web scraping scenarios to reinforce understanding of Python fundamentals;

- Gain experience with essential Python libraries such as `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` commonly used in web scraping;

- Analyze the structure of the Python script to better organize the code;

- Work with data extracted from web pages, using `pandas` for data manipulation and `matplotlib` for basic data visualization;

- Time management.

## Dependencies used

- requests - to make HTTP requests;
- BeautifulSoup – to parse HTML and extract data;
- pandas and matplotlib – to generate graph and table for better visualization.

## Future Plans
The project has plans to implement dynamic data loading using Selenium. Stay tuned for updates!

Feel free to contribute, provide feedback, or suggest improvements.
